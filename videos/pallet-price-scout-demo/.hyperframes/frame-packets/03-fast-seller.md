## Frame 3 — Fate 1: the fast seller

- scene: Punch-in on the Ninja air fryer row of the Single-item pulls table; three rule checks tick on beside it.
- onscreen: "Ninja air fryer" | "48 sold in 30 days" | "3.2 days to sell" | "Exact SKU match ✓" | "Fast seller."
- voiceover: ""
- duration: 6s
- transition_in: crossfade
- status: built
- src: compositions/frames/03-fast-seller.html
- type: feature_showcase
- persuasion: Show-don't-tell proof — the real row, the real thresholds (≥20 sold / 30 days, ≤7 days to sell, exact match)
- beat: confidence
- blueprint: agent-progress-theater (Adapt)
- asset_candidates: assets/view-singles.png — Single-item pulls table: Ninja 48 sold · FAST · 3.2d · 2 on hand · 14 batch · rec 10 · pull 10 · plus the formula line under the table heading; assets/view-dialog-ninja.png — Ninja product dialog, exact match 99%
- focal: assets/view-singles.png
- roles: view-singles = cutout (top strip window, punched in on the Ninja row) · view-dialog-ninja = supporting (unused unless the strip needs a second beat — do not show both)
- sfx: whoosh-short at 0.2s, click-soft at 1.4s / 2.3s / 3.2s, ping at 4.0s

Adapt: keep the receipt that cascades in and CHECKS OFF row by row; the "trigger" is the punch-in onto the real row, the checklist is the fast-seller rule.
Scene 1 (0.0–1.2s): top full-width strip window (sketch block x106 y160 1708×300) punches in on view-singles.png (`coordinate-target-zoom`, fast arrival then locked): frame the table header + Ninja row — page region x433–1767, y600–712 (header labels PRODUCT / 30D SOLD / AVG. DAYS TO SELL / STORE ON-HAND / BATCH QTY / REC. / PULL QTY visible above the row), scaled to the window width (~1.28×). Lock.
Scene 2 (1.2–2.2s): check 1 ticks on in the checklist below (`svg-path-draw` for the ✓ in lime, then the line "exact SKU match" + mono "99%"); simultaneously a 2px lime underline marker sweeps under the product cell in the strip (page x465–900 of the row; `css-marker-patterns` highlight).
Scene 3 (2.2–3.4s): check 2 "48 sold in 30 days" + mono "≥ 20" ticks, marker moves to the 30D SOLD cell (page x925–1060); check 3 "3.2 days to sell" + mono "≤ 7" ticks, marker moves to the AVG. DAYS cell (page x1080–1220). One check per beat.
Scene 4 (3.4–6.0s): "fast seller." enters bottom-right in lime at display scale (smooth long-tail settle, no overshoot) and holds; the FAST badge region in the strip gets one keyword glow pulse (one finite attack-decay lime flash). Hold still.

narrativeRole: First fate. Explain the fast-seller rule through one product, so the rule is a story, not a spec.
keyMessage: Proven sellers are recognised automatically — by real sales, not a hunch.

# agent-progress-theater — Agent Progress Theater

**intent**: Agent work performed as WORKING-STATE theater — a short trigger beat hands the frame to the machine, which then visibly _works_: loaders spin, status phrases swap, dots pulse, counters tick — before the receipt arrives as a card whose rows cascade in and CHANGE STATE (badges flip to checks, labels strike through, severity pills read out), or as a conversation thread building message-by-message onto a camera push-in payoff. The subject is the machine performing labor over time. It is NOT a typed prompt awaiting output (no prompt/input is ever typed — the trigger is a click, a menu choice, or an already-running scan); NOT `cursor-ui-demo` (at most ONE igniting click here, then the cursor exits and the UI performs itself); NOT `grid-card-assemble` (rows there assemble into a static enumeration and hold — rows here are alive: they arrive as agent output and then MUTATE, checking off one by one while the viewer watches).

**roles served**

- Key_Feature (from `agent-progress-theater`): when the feature is the agent doing multi-step work (build a plan / scan a repo / fix a vulnerability / handle infra for you) and the proof is status theater — a loader lockup with a typed label, status couplets swapping under an `[accent]` spinner, then a checklist/findings card that populates and checks off in front of the viewer.
- Key_Feature (from `message-thread-payoff`): when the agent's work lives inside a conversation or automation thread — user/agent bubbles and tool-call/reply cards popping in sequence, the working state carried by pulsing loading dots or rapidly ticking diff counters, resolved by ONE camera push-in tight on the confirmation line (`[reaction pill]`, "Sent using `[@Bot]`", a thank-you bubble).

**duration**: 4.2–11.6s (short members are a single card-and-check-off or thread beat at ~4–5s; long members chain trigger → interstitial → status swaps → receipt card at ~9–12s; thread payoff spans 4.2–9.1s)

**shot structure** (a warm flat canvas — `[off-white / warm beige / near-white bg]`, optional `[faint grid / dot-grid / wavy-line]` texture; white rounded cards with soft drop shadows; ONE `[working accent]` color reserved for the machine (spinner, status words, active step) and one `[done color]` for completion (checks, "Completed"); camera static or ONE slow move — motion is overwhelmingly element-level springs, staggers, and state flips. Two folded sub-shapes — **(A) checklist/findings theater** and **(B) message-thread payoff**.)

- **Scene 1 (0.0–~1.5s) — the trigger.** Something asks the machine to work, in ONE beat:
  - _Variant — option menu (A)_: a centered white pill card poses `[the question]`; it SPRINGS open downward into a rounded menu — `[3–4 option rows]` fade/slide in staggered, each with a number badge. A cursor enters, hover-dances between rows (a pale `[hover fill]` highlight follows it), and CLICKS the chosen row (~press-down spring); the whole menu scales down toward its center and fades out. This is the only cursor appearance in the shot.
  - _Variant — modal click (A)_: close-up of a white modal with `[Dismiss]` / `[action button]`; a hand cursor clicks the action (quick press-down spring); the modal fades away. Optionally followed by a serif `[interstitial line]` on the bare canvas — words land staggered, hold, fade out word-staggered as the bg swaps.
  - _Variant — already working (A)_: a `[Scan in progress]`-style state — a thin `[accent]` arc spinner rotating over a heading + body copy + a `[Starting…]` pill (cursor resting on it, motionless); only the spinner moves. The whole scene then rapidly scales up and fades — a push-through exit.
  - _Variant — workspace push-through (A)_: a rapid camera push-in THROUGH a multi-panel `[workspace: builder / editor / terminal]` — panels scale past the viewport edges and clear away to the bare canvas.
  - _Variant — thread opener (B)_: a `[user bubble]` spring-pops in ("`[the ask]`"), OR a stats card pops in whose green/red `[diff counters]` rapidly tick and settle — the automation's opening receipt.

- **Scene 2 (~1–4s) — the working state (the machine performs).** The frame belongs to the machine; nothing is clickable. Pick 1–3 working motifs and CHAIN them:
  - A loader lockup: a spinning `[accent asterisk / arc]` beside a `[working label]` typed on rapidly ("`Buildi` → `Building plan…`"), a left→right shimmer sweep passing through the letters; the spinner may momentarily morph asterisk↔dot and back.
  - Status couplets: 2–3 centered pairs — a dark `[action line]` over an `[accent status word]` ("Thinking…", "Noodling…") with its spinner — swapping via quick fades/slides at a steady cadence.
  - A `[scan/tool label]` types/expands rightward to its full string, then SHRINKS and DOCKS to the top-left as a fixed corner header (the canvas now belongs to what it produces).
  - A status heading flips tense as rows land beneath it ("Using `[Tool]`" → "Used `[Tool]`"), with a gently pulsing "Thinking" and gray meta-lines ("Exploring `[N]` files…") fading in below.
  - _Variant — thread machinery (B)_: the `[agent reply]` fades/slides up, then a monospace `[tool_call]` line appears beneath it — small icon + `[tool name]` + three pulsing loading dots; OR an instruction bubble scrolls into view (internal window scroll, frame static) followed by a `[brand logo]` pop-in beside a "Sending message…" row. **The pulse dies the instant the result lands** — dots vanish as the payload arrives.

- **Scene 3 (~2–4s) — the receipt cascades in (the payoff engine).** The work materializes as a card that BUILDS:
  - _Variant — checklist (A)_: a white `[Progress / summary]` pill or card SPRING-pops in with a bounce, then springs open downward (or the summary card glides UP as a taller `[findings]` panel expands beneath it). Rows cascade in one by one — slide-up + fade, staggered — each with `[number badge / severity pill]` + `[label]` + optional gray `[meta line]`. Then the STATE MUTATION runs: badges flip one by one from numbered outline to a solid `[done color]` circle + white checkmark (slight scale bounce), the checked label simultaneously strikes through and dims; pending items keep partially-drawn arc outlines animating. End the run mid-list — some items checked, some still numbered — the work is visibly _ongoing_.
  - _Variant — thread payload (B)_: the camera pushes in / pans down centering the `[tool_call]` line as a white payload card expands downward from it — 2–4 light monospace `[key: value]` lines fading in. Then the `[resolution message]` expands into place below (inline `[code chips]` and `[link]` coloring), OR a dark `[thread card]` scales up from a status row to DOMINATE the frame while the background darkens, its `[reply]` expanding into place under a "1 reply" divider.

- **Scene 4 (final ~1–2.5s) — resolve.** Two endings:
  - _Variant — hold / scroll (A)_: the finished (or mid-mutation) card stack holds static to the end, OR the viewport scrolls down the final card (fast in the last beat) revealing `[a second heading + numbered list]`, ending mid-list. A slow continuous zoom into the card may run underneath (the header drifts off the top of frame).
  - _Variant — payoff push-in (B)_: ONE camera push-in + pan-down lands tight on the payoff line — "`Sent using [@Bot]`" / the confirmation + `[thank-you bubble]` spring-in — then a `[reaction button]` springs into an active pill with bouncy overshoot and a count. The push eases into a gentle near-imperceptible drift and the clip ends on the close-up. No end card.

**rule mapping**

- pill springs open downward into a menu / panel expands beneath a gliding card / payload card expands downward from a tool-call line → `anchored-layout-expand` (edge-anchored container growth: height-masked wrapper + inner counter-translate, container drawn at final size); spring flavor from `spring-pop-entrance`
- option rows / findings rows / task rows stagger in (slide-up + fade) → `spring-pop-entrance` (staggered-group form, ≤500ms cap) or `gsap-effects` (plain fade+translate stagger) — NOT `waterfall-entry` (its binary no-fade arrival law contradicts this dialect's soft fade/slide cascade)
- cursor glides to a row and clicks; hand cursor clicks the modal button → `cursor-click-ripple` (move + press) + `press-release-spring` (the button's press-down spring)
- pale hover-highlight fill following the cursor between rows → `gsap-effects` (a background fill translated row-to-row; no dedicated rule needed)
- menu scale-down fade exit / scene scale-up push-through exit / palette-for-window swap → `scale-swap-transition`
- thin arc spinner rotation / spinning asterisk loader → `svg-icon-enrichment` (rotating internal SVG parts via `setAttribute('transform','rotate(deg cx cy)')`; timeline-driven, finite)
- asterisk↔dot morph and back → `scale-swap-transition` (two elements morphing at the same center)
- typed-on loader label ("Building plan…") / scan label typing to its full string → `discrete-text-sequence` (+ `context-sensitive-cursor` for the caret)
- left→right shimmer sweep through the loader letters → `ambient-glow-bloom` (single-pass traveling sheen) or `css-marker-patterns` (highlight sweep) — pick sheen for light-on-text, marker for a drawn band
- serif interstitial word-staggered fade in/out; status couplets swapping on a cadence → `dynamic-content-sequencing` (phrase windows) + `discrete-text-sequence` (the whole-state swaps); per-word stagger via `gsap-effects`
- pulsing "Thinking" label / three pulsing loading dots (phase-offset) → `sine-wave-loop` (finite repeats; kill the tween at the resolve beat — see doctrine note)
- status heading tense flip (Using→Used) / gray meta-lines fading in / final-token snaps → `discrete-text-sequence`
- label shrinks and docks to the top-left as a fixed corner header → `gsap-effects` (plain scale + translate tween; no dedicated rule needed)
- rapid camera push-in through the multi-panel workspace → `viewport-change` (the push) + `multi-phase-camera` (phasing) + optional `motion-blur-streak` (velocity blur as panels clear the frame)
- slow continuous zoom into the receipt card (header drifts off top) → `multi-phase-camera` (steady-push phase) or `viewport-change`
- summary card / progress pill / chat bubble / brand logo / file chip spring pop-in → `spring-pop-entrance`
- summary card glides up as the findings panel expands beneath → `gsap-effects` (the glide) + `anchored-layout-expand` (the panel)
- badge flip: numbered outline → solid circle + white checkmark with scale bounce → `scale-swap-transition` (outline↔solid swap at same center) + `svg-path-draw` (checkmark draw-in) + `spring-pop-entrance` (the bounce); the pending→active→complete progression itself → `dynamic-content-sequencing` (a snap state machine, per cursor-ui-demo's workflow-approve-press precedent)
- strikethrough + dim on the checked label → `css-marker-patterns` (strike-through draw) + `gsap-effects` (opacity dim)
- partially-drawn arc outlines animating on pending items → `svg-path-draw` (partial dashoffset, held mid-draw)
- viewport scroll down the final card / internal window scroll under a static frame → `gsap-effects` (transform-only content translate inside a masked window) — use `viewport-change` only if the FRAME moves
- green/red diff counters rapid tick-and-settle → `counting-dynamic-scale` (numeric proxy count-up; suppress the scale-growth component — these tick at fixed size)
- dark thread card scales up from a row to dominate the frame → `card-morph-anchor` (row → full-frame morph + handoff) with the background darkening as a `gsap-effects` overlay fade
- reply message / resolution line expands into place → `spring-pop-entrance` (soft overshoot) or `anchored-layout-expand` for a true downward growth
- reaction button springs into an active pill with overshoot + count → `spring-pop-entrance` (the pop) + `press-release-spring` (activation flavor) + `counting-dynamic-scale` (the count, if it ticks)
- camera push-in + pan-down centering the tool call / the payoff line → `coordinate-target-zoom` (non-centered target: scale + counter-translate) or `viewport-change`
- slight pull-back then gentle end drift → `multi-phase-camera` (pull-back phase + continuous micro-drift; keep the drift near-imperceptible)
- static hold on the final stack → no rule needed

**camera modifier** (default is a STATIC frame — the theater is element-level; at most ONE real move per shot, chosen from):

- Trigger push-through: a rapid push-in through the opening workspace that clears to the bare canvas → `viewport-change` + `multi-phase-camera`, optional `motion-blur-streak`.
- Receipt zoom: one slow continuous zoom into the checklist card across the whole mutation run, letting the header drift off the top → `multi-phase-camera` (steady push).
- Payoff push-in (sub-shape B's defining move): static through the build, then ONE push-in + pan-down tightening onto the confirmation line, easing to a micro-drift end → `coordinate-target-zoom` / `viewport-change` + `multi-phase-camera` (drift).
- Everything else — swaps, cascades, check-offs, scrolls — happens on a locked frame (any "scroll" is the content translating inside its window, not the camera).

**doctrine note (idle-motion ban)**: the working-state motifs (spinner rotation, pulsing dots, pulsing "Thinking") brush against motion-doctrine's idle-motion ban — here they are DIEGETIC: the pulse _performs_ "the machine is working" and is the narrative content of Scene 2, not decorative breathing. Keep every loop finite, timeline-driven, and seek-safe (`sine-wave-loop` finite repeats, `svg-icon-enrichment` rotation), and kill it at the exact frame the state resolves — the corpus does this explicitly (the loading dots vanish the instant the payload card expands; the spinner swaps out with the loader lockup).

# Coordinate Target Zoom

A simple `scale > 1` on a wrapper pushes off-center content OFF the visible canvas. To zoom _into_ a specific non-centered element, apply scale AND an inverse translation in lockstep so the target lands at viewport center.

## How It Works

Two nested wrappers, separated concerns — never scale and translate on the SAME element (`translate * scale` ≠ `scale * translate` in CSS transform composition):

1. **Outer wrapper** applies `scale` (the zoom) around `transform-origin: 50% 50%`
2. **Inner wrapper** applies `translate(x, y)` (the counter-shift)

The counter-translate is the **negation** of the target's offset from viewport center:

```
T = -offset
```

Derivation: the inner translate moves the target to `offset + T` in pre-scale units; the outer scale S (around center) maps that to `S × (offset + T)`; landing at center means `S × (offset + T) = 0` → **`T = -offset`**. The formula does NOT depend on S — the translate is identical at 1.5×, 2×, or 3×. A common wrong intuition is `T = -offset × (S - 1)`: it coincidentally matches at S = 2 and is wrong at every other scale.

⚠️ **This is the NESTED-wrapper formula.** The single-wrapper camera in [viewport-change.md](viewport-change.md) puts `translate(x,y) scale(S)` on ONE element, where CSS applies scale first — there the counter-translate is **`T = -offset × S`**. The two formulas are not interchangeable; match the formula to the wrapper structure.

## Getting the offset

`T = -offset` is only as good as `offset`. The #1 way this pattern ships broken is hand-computing `offset` from a layout formula, getting the **sign** or magnitude wrong, and letting the zoom amplify a small error off-screen. **Default to measuring the target's real laid-out center; reserve the formula for symmetric rows.**

**Default — measure the actual center (works for ANY layout).** Immune to sign errors because it reads the rendered DOM, not a mental model:

```js
await document.fonts.ready; // metrics final; fallback fonts are 10–30px off → tens of px after a 3×+ zoom
const W = 1920,
  H = 1080;
const r = document.getElementById("target-card").getBoundingClientRect();
const TARGET_OFFSET_X = r.left + r.width / 2 - W / 2;
const TARGET_OFFSET_Y = r.top + r.height / 2 - H / 2;
```

Measure **once at setup** and bake — never per-frame in `onUpdate`. Because the measurement is async (`fonts.ready`), build and register the timeline inside the same `async` setup so the baked offset is ready before `window.__timelines[id]` is published.

**Shortcut — symmetric equal-width row ONLY:**

```js
const index_offset = targetIndex - (N - 1) / 2;
const TARGET_OFFSET_X = index_offset * (CARD_WIDTH + CARD_GAP);
```

⚠️ This assumes every sibling is the **same width**. The moment the row is asymmetric, it gives the wrong answer — often the wrong **sign**: the heavier side shifts the centered target the _opposite_ way you'd guess (e.g. `companion(220) + gap + wordmark + gap + chip(110)` puts the wordmark ~55px **right** of center, but "chip − companion" intuition says left). For anything but equal cards, **measure**.

**Headroom budget — cap the scale from the measured size.** A zoom multiplies any centering error; keep the target ≤ ~88% of the canvas at peak:

```js
const maxScale = Math.min((0.88 * W) / r.width, (0.88 * H) / r.height);
const ZOOM_SCALE = Math.min(DESIRED_SCALE, maxScale);
```

A target filling 97%+ of the frame reads as cut-off the instant its center is slightly off — and a hand-baked offset always is. (The perception gate flags this as `primary-offscreen`; `data-layout-allow-overflow` does **not** exempt it.)

## Recipe

```html
<div class="zoom-outer" id="zoom-outer">
  <div class="zoom-inner" id="zoom-inner">
    <div class="content">
      <div class="card">{other}</div>
      <div class="card target" id="target-card">{target}</div>
      <div class="card">{other}</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.scene {
  overflow: hidden; /* REQUIRED — at zoom > 1 the scaled content leaks past the frame */
}
.zoom-outer {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  transform-origin: 50% 50%; /* center scaling is what the counter-translate math assumes */
  will-change: transform;
}
.zoom-inner {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  will-change: transform;
}
```

```js
// TARGET_OFFSET_X/Y and ZOOM_SCALE come from "Getting the offset" — measured
// at setup (after fonts.ready), baked. Counter-translation = -offset.
const counterX = -TARGET_OFFSET_X;
const counterY = -TARGET_OFFSET_Y;

// Scale and counter-translate MUST share position, duration, AND ease —
// otherwise the target visibly wanders mid-zoom.
tl.to("#zoom-outer", { scale: ZOOM_SCALE, duration: ZOOM_DUR, ease: "power3.inOut" }, ZOOM_AT);
tl.to(
  "#zoom-inner",
  { x: counterX, y: counterY, duration: ZOOM_DUR, ease: "power3.inOut" },
  ZOOM_AT,
);
```

## Variations

- **Zoom out (target → wide view)**: reverse the phases — start zoomed-in, then tween to `scale: 1` + `x: 0, y: 0`; the "reveal" beat is the panorama.
- **Multi-target zoom sequence**: chain zooms (target A → pause → target B → pull back); each segment needs its own counter-translation pair.

## Values

| token      | range                                   | notes                                                                                      |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ZOOM_SCALE | 1.5× modest → 3× dominant → 5×+ extreme | cap via the headroom budget; raster media needs `sourceResolution ≥ rendered × ZOOM_SCALE` |
| ZOOM_DUR   | 1.0–2.0s                                | under 0.8s feels like a teleport, over 2.5s drags; both tweens share it                    |
| ZOOM_AT    | after the layout lands + 0.5–1.5s       | give the viewer time to scan the layout before the camera commits                          |
| DWELL      | ≥ 1.0s after the zoom settles           | 1.5–2s ideal — the viewer must be able to read the target (climax dwell)                   |

## Critical Constraints

- **Outer scales, inner translates** — never both transforms on one element; nested wrappers keep the math clean.
- **`transform-origin: 50% 50%` on the outer wrapper** — non-center origin breaks the counter-translate derivation.
- **`overflow: hidden` on the scene root** — zoomed content leaks past the frame otherwise.
- **Scale and counter-translate share duration + ease** at the same timeline position, or the target drifts mid-zoom.
- **Offset measured once at setup** (after `fonts.ready`), baked — never recomputed per-frame, never hand-derived for a non-symmetric layout (wrong sign → target shoved off-frame).
- **Scale within the headroom budget** — target ≤ ~88% of the canvas at peak, derived from the measured size.

## Selected motion rule: css-marker-patterns

# CSS Patterns for Marker Highlighting

Pure CSS + GSAP implementations of all five MarkerHighlight.js drawing modes — no external library dependency, full timeline control. Snippets show mechanism DOM only, inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core); assume `tl` exists.

Shared scaffold for every mode: the wrap is `position: relative; display: inline`; the text copy is `position: relative` and z-indexed **above** the accent (below it for sketchout, where the lines cross the text).

## 1. Highlight Mode

Yellow marker sweep behind text — the most common mode.

```html
<span class="mh-highlight-wrap">
  <span class="mh-highlight-bar" id="hl-1"></span>
  <span class="mh-highlight-text">highlighted text</span>
</span>
```

```css
.mh-highlight-bar {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0 -6px; /* bleed past the text edges */
  background: #fdd835;
  opacity: 0.35;
  transform: scaleX(0);
  transform-origin: left center;
  border-radius: 3px;
  z-index: 0;
}
```

```js
tl.to("#hl-1", { scaleX: 1, duration: 0.5, ease: "power2.out" }, 0.6);
// Optional hand-drawn skew: gsap.set("#hl-1", { skewX: -2 });
// Multi-line: tl.to(".mh-highlight-bar", { scaleX: 1, ..., stagger: 0.3 }, 0.6);
```

## 2. Circle Mode

Hand-drawn ellipse around text — `border-radius: 50%` plus a slight rotation for organic feel.

```html
<span class="mh-circle-wrap">
  <span class="mh-circle-text">IMPORTANT</span>
  <span class="mh-circle-ring" id="circle-1"></span>
</span>
```

```css
.mh-circle-ring {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  width: 130%; /* tight (short words): 150%; rounded-rect: 120% + border-radius: 30% */
  height: 160%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%) rotate(-3deg) scale(0);
  border: 3px solid #e53935;
  border-radius: 50%;
  z-index: 0;
}
```

```js
tl.to("#circle-1", { scale: 1, rotation: -3, duration: 0.6, ease: "back.out(1.7)" }, 0.7);
```

## 3. Burst Mode

Radiating lines from text center — each line a positioned span rotated to its angle. Use ~12 lines at 30° steps and **vary `--len` (40–80px)**; equal lengths look mechanical.

```html
<span class="mh-burst-wrap">
  <span class="mh-burst-text">WOW</span>
  <span class="mh-burst-container" id="burst-1">
    <span class="mh-burst-line" style="--angle: 0deg; --len: 70px;"></span>
    <span class="mh-burst-line" style="--angle: 30deg; --len: 55px;"></span>
    <!-- …one line per 30° step through 330deg, --len varied 40-80px -->
  </span>
</span>
```

```css
.mh-burst-container {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  width: 0;
  height: 0;
  z-index: 1; /* text copy at z-index: 2 */
}
.mh-burst-line {
  position: absolute;
  display: block;
  width: 3px;
  height: var(--len);
  background: #1e88e5;
  left: -1.5px;
  top: calc(-1 * var(--len));
  transform: rotate(var(--angle));
  transform-origin: bottom center;
  opacity: 0;
}
```

```js
tl.fromTo(
  "#burst-1 .mh-burst-line",
  { scaleY: 0, opacity: 0 },
  { scaleY: 1, opacity: 1, duration: 0.4, ease: "power2.out", stagger: 0.03 },
  0.7,
);
```

## 4. Scribble Mode

Wavy SVG underline that draws itself via `stroke-dashoffset`.

```html
<span class="mh-scribble-wrap">
  <span class="mh-scribble-text">underlined text</span>
  <svg class="mh-scribble-svg" viewBox="0 0 500 24" preserveAspectRatio="none">
    <path
      id="scribble-1"
      d="M0,12 Q31,0 62,12 Q93,24 125,12 Q156,0 187,12 Q218,24 250,12 Q281,0 312,12 Q343,24 375,12 Q406,0 437,12 Q468,24 500,12"
      fill="none"
      stroke="#FDD835"
      stroke-width="3"
      stroke-linecap="round"
    />
  </svg>
</span>
```

```css
.mh-scribble-svg {
  position: absolute;
  left: 0;
  bottom: -6px; /* strikethrough variant: top: 50%; transform: translateY(-50%) */
  width: 100%;
  height: 24px;
  z-index: 0;
}
```

```js
const path = document.querySelector("#scribble-1");
const len = path.getTotalLength();
gsap.set(path, { strokeDasharray: len, strokeDashoffset: len });
tl.to("#scribble-1", { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: 0.8, ease: "power1.inOut" }, 0.7);
```

Path tuning: the `Q` control points alternate y between 0 and 24 for a natural wobble. Tighter waves = smaller x-increments (~25px per half-wave); looser = ~50px; subtler amplitude = y range 0–16.

## 5. Sketchout Mode

Cross-hatch over de-emphasized text — two angled lines create a "crossed out" effect.

```html
<span class="mh-sketchout-wrap">
  <span class="mh-sketchout-text">old price</span>
  <span class="mh-sketchout-lines" id="sketchout-1">
    <span class="mh-sketchout-line mh-sketchout-fwd"></span>
    <span class="mh-sketchout-line mh-sketchout-bwd"></span>
  </span>
</span>
```

```css
.mh-sketchout-lines {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0 -4px;
  overflow: hidden;
  z-index: 1; /* text at z-index: 0 — the lines cross OVER it */
}
.mh-sketchout-line {
  position: absolute;
  display: block;
  top: 50%;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 2px;
  background: #e53935;
  transform-origin: left center;
}
.mh-sketchout-fwd {
  transform: scaleX(0) rotate(-12deg);
}
.mh-sketchout-bwd {
  transform: scaleX(0) rotate(12deg);
}
```

```js
// Forward slash first, backward follows
tl.to("#sketchout-1 .mh-sketchout-fwd", { scaleX: 1, duration: 0.3, ease: "power2.out" }, 1.0);
tl.to("#sketchout-1 .mh-sketchout-bwd", { scaleX: 1, duration: 0.3, ease: "power2.out" }, 1.15);
```

## Combining Modes in Captions

Cycle modes across caption groups for visual variety — every 2-3 groups for high energy, 3-4 for medium, 4-5 for low:

```js
const MODES = ["highlight", "circle", "burst", "scribble"];
GROUPS.forEach((group, gi) => {
  const mode = MODES[gi % MODES.length];
  group.emphasisWords.forEach((word) => applyMode(word.el, mode, tl, word.start));
});
```

# SVG Path Draw

Reveals an SVG shape by animating its stroke as if a pen were tracing it. Two stroke properties together: **`stroke-dasharray = <pathLength>`** makes the entire path one dash; **`stroke-dashoffset`** starts at the path length (dash shifted fully out of view → invisible) and tweens to `0` (fully drawn). The length comes from the DOM API `path.getTotalLength()` — measured, never guessed.

Works on anything with a stroke: `<path>`, `<circle>`, `<rect>`, `<line>`, `<polyline>`, `<polygon>`, `<ellipse>`.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip -->
<svg class="logo-mark" viewBox="0 0 200 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <path id="bar-left" d="M 60 40 L 60 160" />
  <path id="bar-right" d="M 140 40 L 140 160" />
  <path id="bar-mid" d="M 60 100 L 140 100" />
</svg>
```

```css
.logo-mark path {
  fill: none; /* outline-only draw — a fill would appear immediately and ruin the reveal */
  stroke: {accentColor};
  stroke-width: 12;
  stroke-linecap: round; /* softer endpoints */
  stroke-linejoin: round;
}
```

```js
// Setup: measure each path and set its dash pattern. Real measured geometry, not a magic number.
document.querySelectorAll(".logo-mark path").forEach((p) => {
  const len = p.getTotalLength();
  p.style.strokeDasharray = `${len}`;
  p.style.strokeDashoffset = `${len}`;
});

// Stagger draws so the eye reads continuous motion — each segment starts at
// ~70-80% of the previous segment's duration, before it finishes.
tl.to(
  "#bar-left",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-right",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_2_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-mid",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_3_START,
);

// Companion wordmark fades in only after the last stroke settles.
tl.to(
  ".brand-line",
  { opacity: 1, duration: BRAND_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  BRAND_FADE_START,
);
```

## Variations

- **Ring starting at 12 o'clock** — `<circle>` / `<rect>` strokes start at 3 o'clock by default; rotate the element `-90deg` so a progress ring draws from the top:

```html
<circle
  cx="100"
  cy="100"
  r="60"
  id="ring"
  style="transform-origin: 100px 100px; transform: rotate(-90deg)"
/>
```

- **Linear (constant-speed) draw** — `ease: "none"` for a steady-rate "real pen" trace.
- **Draw then fill** — for filled shapes, tween `fillOpacity: 0 → 1` AFTER the stroke completes (requires `fill-opacity: 0` initially and a real `fill` in CSS):

```js
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { fillOpacity: 1, duration: FILL_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  SEG_1_START + SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR,
);
```

## Values

| token             | range                                   | notes                                                                                              |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR  | 0.3–0.8s                                | fast snap vs deliberate pen trace; >~1s feels sluggish for a logo reveal                           |
| FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR | 60–80% of SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR              | proportional to segment length — a short connector at full duration reads slower than its siblings |
| SEG_N_START       | previous start + 70–80% of its duration | reads as continuous motion, not N isolated animations                                              |
| SEG_1_START       | 0–0.4s                                  | a small ~0.2s lead-in lets the viewer settle before motion                                         |
| BRAND_FADE_START  | ≥ last stroke end (+ ~0.2s beat)        | earlier and the wordmark competes with the draw                                                    |
| BRAND_FADE_DUR    | 0.3–0.8s                                | snap (urgent) vs glide (premium)                                                                   |

Ease families are discrete choices: **stroke draws** use `power2.out` (a hand lifting at end of stroke) or `none` for constant speed — never `back.out` / `elastic.out` (pens don't bounce). **Fades** use `power1.out`.

## Critical Constraints

- **`fill: none`** for outline-only draws — otherwise the fill appears immediately.
- **Dasharray/dashoffset = the measured `getTotalLength()`**, set at setup; requires the SVG in the DOM (inline SVG is fine; a loaded `<image>` SVG is not).
- **Complex paths**: if `getTotalLength()` looks wrong, overestimate slightly (`len * 1.05`) — too large is invisible at animation start; too small clips the end.
- **Stagger multi-path draws at ~70–80%** of the previous segment's duration.
- **A drawn line must land on something.** When the path is a connector (rail, beam, underline, callout) rather than a shape, both endpoints must sit on real elements and the draw must do a job — reveal, route, validate, or emphasize. A stroke that only decorates empty space reads as filler; attach it or cut it.
